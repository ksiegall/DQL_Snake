## Introduction

The goal of our final project was to train a model using Deep Q Learning (DQL) to play Snake. Accuracy of the model was measuered using the final game score; higher scores means a better model. We chose this issue because one of our team members loves to play Snake, and we thought it would be interesting to tackle a simple game with DQL.

The model was given: actions, the game board, (**ADD LATER**). The actions that could be taken were: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT

## Methods

**Initial Model**: We just converted the model given in the tutorial from [Paszke and Towers](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html). The reward was just the score of the game.



## Table of Results
**Initial Model**: Kinda shit
